     <p>Will's innate curiosity about the nature of the human spirit lead him to discover his love of yoga.  Initially yoga was a means of pain relief and exercise, but he soon realized this was only one aspect of the larger world of yogic practice.   The calling to help others heal and enrich themselves lead Will to seek out training to become a yoga instructor. He was part of the first graduating class at Vita-Prana Yoga,  studying under Vita Lo Fria and Christy Newsome to receive his 200 RYT.   He is also a certified Arial Yoga instructor, having trained once again under Vita Lo Fria.  Will believes in the human body and human spirit's astounding ability to heal itself and that yoga is the ideal vessel to make us whole throughout our voyage.</p>

     <p>Will was born in Augusta, Georgia and grew up in the metro Atlanta area.  At the age of four he was diagnosed with Legg Calve Perthes disease, a degenerative disorder of the femur.  After two major surgeries and time spent in a wheelchair and crutches, he was able to walk again and eventually even run. Will eventually even completed a marathon in 2014.   From a young age, doctors always told him that he would have to have his hip replaced, even before being middle-aged.  Since Will brought yoga into his life, it has transformed his health and now doctors tell him he will probably never have to have his hip replaced.  He also has scoliosis(very common for individuals with Legg Calve Perthes) and yoga has helped to correct the issues associated with scoliosis.  Related issues with his neck eventually surfaced and got so bad that he started losing feeling in his left arm.  After traditional medicine failed to help his condition, Will immersed himself in asana(physical postures of yoga) and it corrected the problems with his neck and all feeling returned to his arm and it hasn't been an issue since then.  These personal experiences with the healing power of yoga lead Will to want to help others to heal themselves through yogic practice.</p>

     <p>Will's study of the foundations of yogic philosophy started long before he practiced asana as he studied philosophy and religious studies at Georgia State University.  His love of food led him to study the Culinary Arts at Le Cordon Bleu of Atlanta.  Innovative, healthy cuisine is a passion of Will's and he's always eager to share a recipe or technique with anyone.  Although a limited musician himself, Will has a passion for music and takes much care with his musical choices for classes and private sessions. Aside from Seven Days Yoga, Will is also the owner of <a href="http://salvadorkitti.com">Salvador Kitti LLC</a>, along with his Sister and the company's founder Amy.  Amy is an artist that paints portraits of wildlife and they print the images of her paintings on various products.  They donate part of all the proceeds to wildlife conservation organizations.  Animals and wildlife conservation are another of Will's passions in life.</p>

     <p>Will is like a conductor of an orchestra.  He doesn't write the music; the music was written thousands of years ago.  He doesn't play the instruments; the instruments are his student's bodies that they play themselves.  He is simply a guide that leads his students on the path to transformation and transcendence.</p>
