			<p>Join Will for an exploration of the yogic traditions of the Autumnal Equinox, the beginning of fall when the day and night are of equal length. We will delve into the meaning of the sacred number 108 and what it can mean to our lives. The concepts of balance and duality will be woven through pranayama, asana, and guided meditation to leave us prepared for the changing of seasons and the changes within us.</p>
